# Opus

[Opus](https://tryop.us/) is an on-device computer-use app for MacOS that works **fully in the background**.

Current computer use solutions are slow, expensive, or limited in some way. Opus takes a new approach by programmatically interacting with apps using AppleScript, the MacOS API, and a other tools. Additionally, Opus is able to work 100% in the background without restricting any sort of functionality from the user.

## How it works

At its core, Opus is a set of LLM-friendly tools that can perform tasks. It can take context from:

- the current UI elements
- the current selected UI element
- any app's AppleScript dictionaries
- the current screen (screenshot)
- the user's installed apps
- previous tool calls it has made

Opus will then choose from the following actions:

- running an AppleScript
- clicking an element
- running a Bash script
- visiting a URI
- keypress
- mouse click

to accomplish the user's task.
